Since the conclusion of the Cold War, the United States has gathered substantial evidence regarding political and economic intervention by its principal competitor, China. Despite this abundant evidence, Washington often dismisses the Chinese Communist Party's (CCP) growth and intervention as a mere consequence of an expanding global market. China and its subsidiaries maintain ties across various sectors in the U.S., ranging from media involvement to American index and retirement funds. Consequently, China’s intervention in both U.S. domestic and foreign affairs is a central component of its "grand strategy" aimed at global domination. The article "Beijing’s American Hustle," authored by Matt Pottinger, addresses this critical global issue and proposes necessary actions for international, domestic, and individual actors.

The primary concern is the CCP’s grand strategy of global dominance. This issue encompasses several layers, including the lack of effective policies to counteract foreign monopolies, social media intervention, and political warfare. Additionally, government officials and elites have connections to the CCP through entities like the United Front Work Department (UFWD). The absence of effective policies to subsidize industries in semiconductor manufacturing to reduce dependency on China and decades of inadequate responses to free trade with China have fostered detrimental habits in U.S. policy-making.

The central argument is that Washington has repeatedly ignored the growing dominance of the Chinese economy, resulting in the U.S. becoming economically dependent on a hostile nation. The author primarily adopts a liberal perspective but incorporates elements of realist theory, particularly regarding protectionist policies. The author emphasizes that while free trade is essential to a functioning democracy, the U.S. should adopt more protectionist policies with China due to its economic threat.

The article employs empirical evidence, such as Rush Doshi’s research for "The Long Game," which includes decades of Chinese speeches, policy documents, and memoirs. However, it lacks substantial qualitative or quantitative research, relying instead on testimonial and primary sources like Cai Xia’s statements and recent events like Chinese import barriers on Australian products. The UFWD’s employment of millions to gather intelligence and influence individuals is highlighted as a significant concern.

The main actors include the U.S. government and institutions, which play both domestic and international roles, aiming to support global liberal democracy. However, post-Cold War policies have inadvertently facilitated China’s economic rise. Public corporations have significantly contributed to China’s growth through investments driven by capital expansion motives. Technology giants have neglected to develop systems to counter CCP political warfare. Western citizens are impacted by the CCP’s political warfare campaigns, which utilize social media to propagate propaganda and amplify social tensions.

To address the issue effectively, the following legislative measures are recommended: 
1. Enforce regulations on technology companies to counter CCP political warfare and media intervention. 
2. Heavily subsidize domestic semiconductor manufacturing, particularly given China’s ambitions regarding Taiwan. 
3. Implement stringent regulations on the financial sector to enforce bans on blacklisted Chinese companies. 
4. Collaborate with media companies to counter CCP propaganda and promote authentic news, while revitalizing campaigns to promote American values. 
5. Encourage citizens to fact-check and scrutinize media consumption to mitigate the influence of Chinese bots and proxies.
