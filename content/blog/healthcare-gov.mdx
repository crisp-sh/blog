## Introduction
On March 23, 2010, President Obama signed the Affordable Care Act into law, marking a significant milestone in U.S. healthcare reform. This landmark legislation, often referred to as “Obamacare,” aimed to increase healthcare access to all Americans. Central to Obamacare’s implementation was HealthCare.gov, an online platform designed to facilitate the comparison, purchase, and eligibility of health insurance plans. However, the launch of HealthCare.gov on October 1, 2013, became a pivotal moment, not for its success, but for the array of failures that exposed critical flaws in policy formulation and structural organization within the federal government’s approach to working on large-scale IT projects.
