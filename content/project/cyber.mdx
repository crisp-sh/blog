## Data and Methods
All of the material is based on the open source "national cyber power index" (NCPI) dataset
released by associates at the Harvard Belfer Center (Voo et al., 2020). Reliability
and validity often remain issues for macro-political indices, and the NCPI dataset is not an
exception in this regard. However, the dataset is accompanied with a very detailed and properly-sourced 
codebook from which the indices have been constructed. Additionally, the NCPI dataset provides the
individual variables from which the composite "cyber power index" has been constructed.

Thus, two separate dependent variables are used to proxy BMC. The primary variable is the extent and 
quality of bilateral and multilateral agreements in cyber space. This encompasses formal contracts, 
such as memberships in both regional and international organizations, as well as informal agreements 
like joint declarations and cooperation frameworks. This variable is measured on a continuous scale, 
where higher values signify a greater number and more formal agreements. The secondary variable serves 
as a proxy for a nation's support of cyber norms. It is evaluated based on eleven criteria, predominantly 
focusing on a country's involvement in international organizations. These organizations include both 
“talkshops”, such as the Internet Governance Forum (IGF) and the Global Forum for Cyber Expertise (GFCE), and
more technical cooperation avenues, such as the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) 
and the International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC). In addition, national cyber security strategies 
and related commitments are accounted for in the coding. The range of this variable is scaled to the unit interval.
