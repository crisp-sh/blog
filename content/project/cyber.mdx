# Research Question
Does a country’s cyber security power and capability influence its willingness to engage in quality 
bilateral and multilateral cooperation (BMC) through formal and informal agreements and norms?

# Dataset
All of the material is based on the open source "national cyber power index" (NCPI) dataset
released by associates at the Harvard Belfer Center (Voo et al., 2020). Reliability
and validity often remain issues for macro-political indices, and the NCPI dataset is not an
exception in this regard. However, the dataset is accompanied with a very detailed and properly-sourced 
codebook from which the indices have been constructed. Additionally, the NCPI dataset provides the
individual variables from which the composite "cyber power index" has been constructed.

Thus, two separate dependent variables are used to proxy BMC. The primary variable is the extent and 
quality of bilateral and multilateral agreements in cyber space. This encompasses formal contracts, 
such as memberships in both regional and international organizations, as well as informal agreements 
like joint declarations and cooperation frameworks. This variable is measured on a continuous scale, 
where higher values signify a greater number and more formal agreements. The secondary variable serves 
as a proxy for a nation's support of cyber norms. It is evaluated based on eleven criteria, predominantly 
focusing on a country's involvement in international organizations. These organizations include both 
“talkshops”, such as the Internet Governance Forum (IGF) and the Global Forum for Cyber Expertise (GFCE), and
more technical cooperation avenues, such as the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) 
and the International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC). In addition, national cyber security strategies 
and related commitments are accounted for in the coding. The range of this variable is scaled to the unit 
interval.

## Independent Variables
### Cyber Power
1. __stateattack__: Number of publicly attributed, notable, and sophisticated state-sponsored cyber attacks.
2. __attacksurveillance__: Deﬁned analogously to the __stateattack__ variable, but with a surveillance objective.
3. __attackcontrol__: Like __stateattack__, but with a control objective.
4. __attackintelligence__: Ibid., but with an intelligence objective.
5. __attackcommercial__: Ibid., but with a commercial objective.
6. __attackoffense__: Ibid., but with an offensive objective.
7. __intentoffense__: A variable with a [0, 1] range; based on seven questions asking whether a country’s cyber military planning, strategy documents, etc. acknowledge the capability for destructive cyber operations, including the destroying or disabling of adversaries’ infrastructures and capabilities.

### Cyber Capability
1. __militarystrategy__: A national cyber strategy detailing defensive and (or) offensive military capabilities in the cyber space, ranked by consistency of the strategy.
2. __cybermilpeople__: Number of staff in military cyber forces.
3. __cybercommand__: The presence of a national, centralized cyber command, ranked by years since establishment.
